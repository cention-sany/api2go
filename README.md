[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/manyminds/api2go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/manyminds/api2go)

Forked from project [api2go](https://github.com/manyminds/api2go).

## Features
- Most of the features in original project [api2go](https://github.com/manyminds/api2go).
- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) is the main framework and [google/jsonapi](https://github.com/google/jsonapi) marshaler and unmarshaler tool.
- Original project supports Gin framework as adapter which do not work well with Gin middlewares especially the Gin RouterGroup.
